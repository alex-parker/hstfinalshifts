### Astrometric shift files used for shift-and-stack trans-Neptunian Object discovery in HST programs GO 13633 and AR 14309.

Alex Parker, Simon Porter, Susan Benecchi, Amanda Zangari

The files in this directory apply to pairs of orbits aquired as part of HST GO 13633. The visit IDs each set apply to are included in the .tar file names.

File JM_Filtered_orbitsLOWDV.dat includes the synthetic source orbits for which the shift rates in the .tar directories were optimized. These orbits are drawn from the CFEPS L7 model (Petit et al. 2011) trimmed to limit the delta-v required for New Horizons to reach them during a post-Pluto mission.

File orbgen_20180126.txt inclused the synthetic orbits for all implanted sources used for flux calibration.
